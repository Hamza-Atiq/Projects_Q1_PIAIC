### Introduction

This program allows the user to input the lengths of the three sides of a triangle and calculates its perimeter by summing the values of these sides. It’s an excellent demonstration of how to use basic arithmetic, data types, and error-handling techniques to handle user input effectively.

### Program Overview

The program follows these steps:
1. **Prints the program's purpose** – Briefly introduces the task to the user.
2. **Accepts input for each side of the triangle** – Prompts the user to enter the length of three sides.
3. **Calculates the perimeter** – Sums the three side lengths to compute the triangle's perimeter.
4. **Displays the result** – Outputs the calculated perimeter.

The program includes error handling to ensure that invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values, are identified and reported to the user.

### Code Explanation

Here’s a quick breakdown of the code:

```python
def main():
    print('Program calculates the perimeter of a triangle')

    try:
        side1 : float = float(input('Enter the first side: '))
        side2 : float = float(input('Enter the second side: '))
        side3 : float = float(input('Enter the third side: '))

        perimeter = side1 + side2 + side3

        print(f'The perimeter of the triangle is {perimeter}')
    except ValueError:
        print('Invalid input!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

- **Variable Declarations** – The program uses `float` to allow decimal values for each side.
- **Error Handling** – Ensures users are prompted with an error message if they enter non-numeric values.
- **Output Formatting** – Displays the perimeter with descriptive text using `print()` and f-string formatting.

### Example Usage

Here’s an example of the program in action:

```
Program calculates the perimeter of a triangle
Enter the first side: 5
Enter the second side: 7.5
Enter the third side: 10
The perimeter of the triangle is 22.5
```

### How to Run the Program

1. Ensure Python is installed (verify by typing `python --version` in your terminal).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the directory containing the program.
4. Run the program with:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
   Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of the script.

This program provides a practical approach to understanding basic input handling, arithmetic, and data validation in Python.
