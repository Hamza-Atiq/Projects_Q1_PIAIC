### Example Run

```plaintext
Program calculate square of the number
Enter the number to see its square: 5
The square of 5.0 is 25.0
```

### Code Explanation

- **Input Prompt**: The program uses `input()` to capture a user-defined number.
- **Square Calculation**: The number is multiplied by itself to find the square, stored in the variable `square`.
- **Error Handling**: A `try-except` block checks if the input is a valid number. If not, it shows an error message.
- **Formatted Output**: The result is displayed with `f-string` formatting, providing clear and concise feedback.
