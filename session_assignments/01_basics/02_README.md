# Reverse Countdown Program

## Overview
This Python program takes a positive integer input from the user and counts down from that number to 1. Once the countdown completes, it displays the message **"Lift off!"**. The program includes error handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully.

## Features
- **Interactive Input:** Users can provide any positive integer.
- **Countdown Logic:** Counts down in reverse order, displaying all numbers on the same line.
- **Error Handling:** Displays an appropriate message for non-integer inputs.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

### Running the Script
1. Save the program in a file named `reverse_countdown.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
3. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python reverse_countdown.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions.

### Example
#### Valid Input:
```plaintext
Program counts the numbers in reverse order and then says "Lift off!"
Enter a number: 5
5 4 3 2 1 Lift off!
```

#### Invalid Input:
```plaintext
Program counts the numbers in reverse order and then says "Lift off!"
Enter a number: abc
Invalid input!
```

## Code Explanation

### Main Function
- The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
- It prompts the user to enter a number, checks if the input is valid, and performs the countdown.
- If the input is invalid, a `ValueError` is caught, and an error message is displayed.

### Logic Flow
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensures the user provides an integer.
2. **Countdown Loop**:
   - Uses a `for` loop with the range `(input_value, 0, -1)` to count down.
   - Prints each number on the same line using the `end=" "` parameter.
3. **Final Message**:
   - Displays **"Lift off!"** once the countdown completes.
